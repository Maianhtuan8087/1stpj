The prevalence of thalassemia in mainland China: evidence from epidemiological surveys;The geographic distribution of thalassemia was highest in the south of China.;2017;89;"Comprehensive data regarding the epidemiology and prevalence of thalassemia in mainland China are lacking. To assess the prevalence of thalassemia, we performed a meta-analysis including 16 articles published from 1981 to 2015. The overall prevalence of α-thalassemia, β-thalassemia and α + β-thalassemia was 7.88%, 2.21% and 0.48%, respectively. Trends in thalassemia prevalence in mainland China were not steady; a prevalence map based on a geographic information system (GIS) showed that the geographic distribution of thalassemia was highest in the south of China and decreased from south to north. Additionally, the most common α- and β-globin gene mutation was --SEA and CD41/42, respectively. The current study provides valuable information regarding epidemiology and intervention and supports the planning, implementation and management of prevention programmes for public health.";;• α thalassemia, β thalassemia and α + β thalassemia prevalence in mainland China
Thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies in an ethnic minority group in Central Vietnam: implications to health burden and relationship between two ethnic minority groups;Thalassemia genes are found among some ethnic minority groups in Vietnam.;2017;6;Thalassemia is a genetic condition that can result in long and expensive treatments, and severe thalassemia may lead to death if left untreated. Couples contributing two genes for thalassemia place their children at particular risk for severe thalassemia. Gene frequency of thalassemia varies in Vietnam, but presents remarkably high levels among some ethnic minority groups. Limited information about thalassemia frequency makes prevention and control of thalassemia difficult. This study aimed to determine gene frequency of certain types of thalassemia among 390 women of reproductive age of the Ta-Oi ethnic minority. Hemoglobin and DNA analyses were carried out to diagnose thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies. Of the total participants, 56.1% (95% CI = 51.1–61.1) carried thalassemia genes. A remarkably high frequency of hemoglobin Constant Spring (Hb CS) of 23.8% (95% CI = 19.7–28.4) was noted. The frequency of α+-thalassemia (−3.7 kb deletion) was 26.4% (95% CI = 22.1–31.1), while hemoglobin E (Hb E) and hemoglobin Paksé (Hb Ps) were identified at frequencies of 14.6 (95% CI = 11.2–18.5) and 2.6% (95% CI = 1.4–5.0), respectively. Further analysis of α-globin gene haplotype revealed the same Hb CS haplotype (+ − M + + −) as of the Co-Tu minority, a neighboring minority of the Ta-Oi, indicating that these two minorities may share the same ancestors. This information will be helpful for further studies in population genetics, as well as the development prevention and control program in the region.;390;"• gene frequency of thalassemia among 390 women of reproductive age of the Ta Oi ethnic minority

Comparison of gene mutation spectrum of thalassemia in different regions of China and Southeast Asia;Thalassemia was thought to exist only in southern China.;2019;14;Thalassemia is a common genetic disorder. High prevalence of thalassemia is found in South China, Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, and the Mediterranean regions. Thalassemia was thought to exist only in southern China, but an increasing number of cases from northern China have been recently reported.;1,059;
Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathies in an Ethnic Minority Group in Northern Vietnam;The prevalence of thalassemia in 289 Tay women was 15.6% (gene frequency 0.078) for 0-thal, 10.0% (gene frequency 0.050) for +-thal, 7.3% (gene frequency 0.036) for -thal, 2.4% (gene frequency 0.012) for Hb Constant Spring, and 1.7% (gene frequency 0.00;2019;6;"Abstract This study assessed thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies in a group of the Tay ethnic minority. Participants included 289 women of reproductive-age who enrolled in a pilot screening program for thalassemia conducted at six communities of Thai Nguyen Province, northern Vietnam. Standard procedures including complete blood count (CBC), hemoglobin (Hb) and DNA analyses were performed for all samples. The prevalence of thalassemia in 289 Tay women was 15.6% (gene frequency 0.078) for α0-thalassemia (α0-thal), 10.0% (gene frequency 0.050) for α+-thal, 7.3% (gene frequency 0.036) for β-thalassemia (β-thal), 2.4% (gene frequency 0.012) for Hb Constant Spring [Hb CS; α142, Term→Gln, TAA>CAA (α2), HBA2: c.427T>C] and 1.7% (gene frequency 0.009) for Hb E [β26(B8)Glu→Lys, GAG>AAG; HBB: c.79G>A]. Further analysis of β-globin gene abnormalities identified four mutations including codons 41/42 (–TCTT) (HBB: c.126_129delCTTT), codon 17 (A>T) (HBB: c.52A>T), codons 71/72 (+A) (HBB: c.216_217insA), and –28 (A>G) (HBB: c.78A>G). The results hint at the remarkably high frequencies of severe forms of thalassemia that indicate a serious public health problem requiring further exploration, and most probably, also intervention within the country.";289;"• prevalence of thalassemia in 289 Tay women
