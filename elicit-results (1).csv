Couples contributing two genes for thalassemia place their children at particular risk for severe thalassemia. Gene frequency of thalassemia varies in Vietnam, but presents remarkably high levels among some ethnic minority groups. Limited information about thalassemia frequency makes prevention and control of thalassemia difficult. This study aimed to determine gene frequency of certain types of thalassemia among 390 women of reproductive age of the Ta-Oi ethnic minority. Hemoglobin and DNA analyses were carried out to diagnose thalassemia and hemoglobinopathies. Of the total participants, 56.1% (95% CI = 51.1–61.1) carried thalassemia genes. A remarkably high frequency of hemoglobin Constant Spring (Hb CS) of 23.8% (95% CI = 19.7–28.4) was noted. The frequency of α+-thalassemia (−3.7 kb deletion) was 26.4% (95% CI = 22.1–31.1), while hemoglobin E (Hb E) and hemoglobin Paksé (Hb Ps) were identified at frequencies of 14.6 (95% CI = 11.2–18.5) and 2.6% (95% CI = 1.4–5.0), respectively. Further analysis of α-globin gene haplotype revealed the same Hb CS haplotype (+ − M + + −) as of the Co-Tu minority, a neighboring minority of the Ta-Oi, indicating that these two minorities may share the same ancestors.

Thalassemia is a severe disease that occurs due to abnormalities in hemoglobin genes. Various genetic factors in different populations lead to different clinical manifestations of thalassemia disease, particularly among people who have a long history of migration and who have married among tribes, such as the hill tribe people in Thailand. This genetic epidemiological study aimed to estimate the prevalence of various forms of thalassemia among the six main hill tribe populations in Thailand.

METHODS

A cross-sectional study was conducted to obtain information and blood specimens from school children belonging to one of the six main hill tribes in Thailand: Akha, Lau, Hmong, Yao, Karen, and Lisu. Hill tribe children who were attending grades 4-6 in 13 selected schools in Chiang Rai Province, Thailand, were invited to participate in the study. A validated questionnaire and 3 mL blood specimens were collected after obtaining information consent forms from both the children and their parents on a voluntary basis. A complete blood count (CBC) was performed, followed by osmotic fragility (OF) and dichlorophenol indophenol precipitation (DCIP) tests to screen for thalassemia. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were used to identify hemoglobin type and α-thalassemia, respectively. A t-test, chi-square and logistic regression were used to detect the associations between variables at the significance level of α = 0.05.

RESULTS

A total of 1,200 participants from 6 different tribes were recruited for the study; 50.0% were males, and 67.3% were aged 11-12 years. The overall prevalence of thalassemia carriers according to the screening tests was 9.8% (117 of 1,200). Among the cases, 83 were A2A (59 cases were α-thalassemia 1 carrier or α-thalassemia 2 carrier or homozygous α-thalassemia 2, and 24 cases were β-thalassemia trait with or without α-thalassemia); 1 case was EE (homozygous Hb E with or without α-thalassemia); 31 cases were EA (30 cases were the Hb E trait, and 1 case was Hb E trait with or without α-thalassemia); 1 case was A2A Bart's H (Hb H disease α-thalassemia 1/α-thalassemia 2); and 1 case was A2A with abnormal Hb. The prevalence of the α-thalassemia 1 trait among the hill tribe population was 2.5%. The greatest prevalence of the α-thalassemia 1 trait was found in the Karen (3.0%) and Hmong (3.0%) tribes.

CONCLUSIONS

The prevalence of some forms of thalassemia in the hill tribe population is higher than that in the Thai and other populations. Effective and available thalassemia screening tests, including essential information to protect the next generation through the specific counseling clinic, are crucial, particularly due to increasing marriages within these populations.",,,"1,200",,• prevalence of thalassemia carriers according to the screening tests

Abnormal globin gene in thalassemia describes its type. Patients who have defective alpha globin genes suffer from alpha thalassemia and patients who have defective beta globin genes suffer from beta thalassemia. There are clinical presentations which varied widely in thalassemia patients, the severity range from asymptomatic to severe anemia in which blood transfusions are needed for lifetime and in multiple organ system many complications occur.1 Alpha thalassemia has been prevailed in India, Africa and South East Africa. Beta thalassaemia has been spread in many areas of Middle East, Mediterranean, in Southern China, in South, Central and South East Asia. The carriers of alpha thalassemia are 5% and of beta thalassemia is 1.5% all over the world. Genotypes of alpha and beta thalassaemia are highly prevalent in those regions which are infected with Plasmodium falciparum. This leads to a theory that evolutionary protection mechanism is represented by thalassemia gene mutation. The populations which are at risk to thalassemia are migrating towards non-endemic areas and increasing the rate of thalassemia gene mutations all over the world.2",,,,,

Its management is complex and expensive, and requires a multiple-team approach. Optimal and sufficient clinical care is demanding. Aim The aim of this study was to determine the magnitude, sex and age distribution, clinical profile, complications, investigation, and management of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia major among Yemeni pediatric patients attending the Yemeni Society Centers for Thalassemia and Genetic Blood Disorders in Yemen as, to our knowledge, no similar previous study has been carried out in Yemen. Patients and methods This was a prospective, cross-sectional, descriptive study carried out during the period from January 2015 to December 2016. A total of 109 Yemeni pediatric transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia major patients who attended the Yemeni Society Centers for Thalassemia and Genetic Blood Disorders in Yemen were included. Detailed assessment of history, clinical examination, investigations, treatment, and follow-up were performed for every patient. The data were collected from the medical records of the patients. Results There was a slight male predominance (53.2%), with a male to female ratio of 1.14 : 1. Approximately 33% of the patients were in the age group 7–10 years, followed by the age group 3–6 years. The mean age of the cases was 7.68±5.8 years. Positive parent consanguinity was present (74.2%) and the majority (64.2%) were first-degree relatives. The best outcome of thalassemia was among those patients 1.7 years old or younger at the time of diagnosis and those patients 2 years old or younger at first blood transfusion. Earlier initiation of chelating therapy yielded better outcomes and reduced the mortality rate with a highly statistically significant difference. The usage of a combination of both oral chelation and subcutaneous iron chelation (iron pump) therapies led to a noticeably better outcome and reduced the mortality rate markedly. A proportional relation was detected between serum ferritin level and mortality among the cases, with a statistically significant difference. The complication rate was high (40.2%). The mortality rate was also high (27.5%). Cardiac dysfunction was the major risk factor of death among our thalassemic patients as about 60% of the deaths were because of cardiac complications, with a highly statistically significant difference. Conclusion Increasing awareness of the morbidity and mortality of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia major among pediatric Yemeni patients, with an emphasis on the great importance of premarital screening before marriage in Yemen, is mandatory. For better outcomes, routine investigations to detect early complications with proper treatment of the predisposing factors and complications are necessary.",,,109,chelation therapy,"• magnitude, sex and age distribution, clinical profile, complications, investigation, and management of transfusion dependent β thalassemia major among Yemeni pediatric patients"

Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen and is made of two proteins from four α-globin genes and two β-globin genes. A defect in one or more of these genes causes thalassemia. The treatment of thalassemia mostly depends on life-long blood transfusions and removal of excessive iron from the blood stream. Such tremendous blood consumption puts pressure on the national blood stock in many countries. In particular, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), various forms of thalassemia prevention have been used and hence, the substantial reduction of the thalassemia major population has been achieved. However, the thalassemia carrier population still remains high, which leads to the potential increase in the thalassemia major population through carrier-carrier marriages. In this work, we investigate the long-term impact and efficacy of thalassemia prevention measures via mathematical modeling at a population level. To our best knowledge, this type of assessment has not been done before and there is no mathematical model that has investigated such a problem for thalassemia or any blood disorders at a population level. By using UAE data, we perform numerical simulations of our model and conduct sensitivity analysis of parameter values to see which parameter values affect most the dynamics of our model. We discover that the prevention measures can contribute to reduce the prevalence of the disease only in the short term but not eradicate the disease in the long term.",,,,,• long term impact and efficacy of thalassemia prevention measures

About 56000 conceptions result in thalassemia, globally. Objective To assess the epidemiological profile of thalassemia in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Methods A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed (National Library of Medicine), CINAHL, and Embase. Relevant observational studies reporting the epidemiology of thalassemia among the GCC population were selected. Data on the prevalence, frequency, and complications of thalassemia were extracted. The quality of the retrieved studies was assessed according to the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Results Eighteen studies (14 cross-sectional studies, two retrospective observational studies, and two retrospective analysis) with a total of 3343042 participants were included in this systematic review. Of the 18 studies, 11 studies were conducted in Saudi Arabia, two in the Kingdom of Bahrain, one in Kuwait, three in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and one in Qatar. The prevalence of thalassemia among children below five years of age ranged from 0.25% to 33%, while it was 0.9% in children above five years and from 0.035% to 43.3% among adult thalassemia patients. The most-reported risk factors were consanguineous marriage and high-risk marriage. There was a lack of data regarding mortality rates in thalassemia. Conclusions Despite the premarital screening and genetic counseling (PMSGC) program for thalassemia, the incidence of high-risk couple marriages in GCC countries cannot be effectively diminished. This study suggested that the PMSGC program should adopt more attention for the high-risk areas, to enhance the level of consciousness about the hemoglobinopathy diseases and the consequences of consanguinity among the at-risk couple.",,Systematic Review,3343042,,"• prevalence of thalassemia among children below 5 years of age

DNA‐based diagnosis elucidated the molecular basis of the disease and clarified the variable clinical picture. It also paved the way for modern methods of carrier identification and prevention via DNA‐based prenatal diagnosis. Every aspect of supportive care, including safer blood supply, more regular transfusions, specific monitoring of iron overload, parenteral and oral chelation, and other therapies, has prolonged life and improved the quality of life of these patients. Significant advances have also been made in allogenic bone marrow transplantation, the only curative therapy. Recently, there has been a rejuvenated interest in studying thalassemia at the basic science level, leading to the discovery of previously unknown mechanisms leading to anemia and enabling the development of novel therapies. These will potentially improve the treatment of, and possibly cure the disease. Pathways involving activin receptors, heat shock proteins, JAK2 inhibitors and macrophage targeted therapy, among others, are being studied or are currently in clinical trials for treating thalassemia. Novel types of genetic therapies are in use or under investigation. In addition to the challenges of treating each individual patient, the longer survival of thalassemia patients has raised considerations regarding worldwide control of thalassemia, since prevention is not universally implemented. This review will trace a number of the original medical milestones of thalassemia diagnosis and treatment, as well as some of the most recent developments which may lead to innovative therapeutic modalities.

A total of 6231 unrelated subjects in two main geographical cities of the Chaoshan region was analyzed for thalassemia. Seven hundred and thirty-six cases of suspected thalassemia carriers with microcytosis [mean corpuscular volume (MCV) <82.0 fL] were found by complete blood cell (CBC) count, and were tested by reverse dot-blot gene chip to reveal a total of 331 mutant chromosomes, including 278 α-thalassemia (α-thal) alleles and 53 β-thalassemia (β-thal) alleles. The most common α-thal mutations were the Southeast Asian (– –SEA), followed by the –α3.7 (rightward) and –α4.2 (leftward) deletions. The two most common β-thal mutations were HBB: c.316-197C>T and HBB: c.126_129delCTTT, accounting for 69.81% of the β-thal defects in the studied individuals.

In its more severe form, severe anemia is present, and treatment with frequent red blood cell transfusion is necessary. Because the body has limited capacity to excrete iron, concomitant iron chelation is required to prevent the complications of iron overload. The effects of chronic anemia and iron overload can lead to multiple end-organ complications such as cardiomyopathy, increased risks of blood-borne diseases, and liver, pituitary, and bone disease. However, our understanding of thalassemia bone disease is incomplete and is composed of a complex piecemeal of risk factors that include genetic factors, hormonal deficiency, marrow expansion, skeletal dysmorphism, iron toxicity, chelators, and increased bone turnover. The high prevalence of bone disease in transfusion-dependent thalassemia is seen in both younger and older patients as life expectancy continues to improve. Indeed, hypogonadism and GH deficiency contribute to a failure to achieve peak bone mass in this group. The contribution of kidney dysfunction to bone disease in thalassemia is a new and significant complication. This coincides with studies confirming an increase in kidney stones and associated accelerated bone loss in the thalassemia cohort. However, multiple factors are also associated with reduced bone mineral density and include marrow expansion, iron toxicity, iron chelators, increased bone turnover, GH deficiency, and hypogonadism. Thalassemia bone disease is a composite of not only multiple hormonal deficiencies but also multiorgan diseases.

There are two main types, alpha thalassemia, and beta-thalassemia. Beta Thalassemia Major (also called Cooley's Anemia) is a serious illness. Symptoms appear in the first two years of life and include paleness of the skin, poor appetite, irritability, and failure to grow. There is absent or decreased production of normal hemoglobin, resulting in microcytic anemia of varying degrees. The thalassemias have a distribution concomitant with areas where P. falciparum malaria is common. The alpha thalassemias are concentrated in Southeast Asia, Malaysia, and southern China. The beta thalassemias are seen primarily in the areas surrounding the Mediterranean Sea, Africa, and Southeast Asia. Proper treatment includes routine blood transfusions and other therapies which can lead to iron overload and contraction of infections such as HIV, HCV, and HBV shortening the life span of patients. On the other hand, inadequate transfusions may lead to severe anemia and debility. Material and Methods: This retrospective record-based cross-sectional study was conducted in S.N. Medical College, Agra. Results: In our tertiary center, we have 103 registered patients of thalassemia, in which 44 are females and 59 are males. Out of the 103 thalassemia cases, 95 (92.2%) belonged to beta-thalassemia major, 4(3.8%) of beta-thalassemia intermediate, and 1 (0.9%) of beta-thalassemia minor category. Fever was the most common presenting symptom. Pallor and hepatomegaly were the most common signs among cases. Conclusion: Hemoglobinopathies are the commonest hereditary disorders in India and pose a major health problem. The data on the prevalence of β-thalassemias and other hemoglobinopathies in different caste/ethnic groups of India is scarce.",,,,,

In order to obtain reliable prevalence data, the gene frequencies of the thalassemias and other hemoglobinopathies should be investigated. Molecular studies on thalassemia have yet to be done for Brunei’s population. It was estimated that carriers of thalassemia or hemoglobinopathies in Brunei is approximately 5.0% or less of the overall population. There are about 200 current cases of thalassemia and other hemoglobinopathies including adults and children reported across all four districts of Brunei. Blood parameter analysis, microscopy, hemoglobin (Hb) electrophoresis and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are the most common methods of investigation in aiding diagnosis in the hospital laboratory. Genotyping analysis conducted in an overseas laboratory has been employed to confirm some diagnosis.

Method: A total of 645 blood samples were obtained from all over Sabah for thalassemia screening in the month of May 2013. High performance Liquid Chromatography and Capillary Electrophoresis were used for analyzing the hemoglobin subtypes.

Result: 94% of the total sample came from voluntary screening offered at primary care level and various government-promoted programs while the other 6% were cascade screening. The study included patients from the age of 1 to 73 years old. The majority (97%; 624/645) were indigenous people and 94% of the total sample came from voluntary screening offered at primary care level via various government promoted programs. 82% were female, mostly screened during their antenatal visit. 30% (193/645) of the sample were tested positive for; β-Thalassemia trait (78%; 151/193), HbE trait (10%; 20/193), Homozygous HbE (2%; 4/193) and other haemoglobinopathies (7%; 13/193). The other 3% (5/193) of the abnormal results were inconclusive hence would require further molecular analysis. Among all the indigenous people screened, the Kadazandusuns had the highest occurrence of haemoglobinopathies (35%; 87/250), followed by the Muruts (33%; 15/45), Malays (29%; 19/65), other races (26%; 46/180) and the Bajau people (23%; 19/84).

Conclusion: Thalassemia is prevalent in the indigenous population of Sabah and most people are asymptomatic.

Hemoglobinopathies (HgP) are prevalent in certain regions of the world. The World Health Organization estimated that 5% of the world's population is a carrier of the potentially pathological hemoglobin (Hb) gene.

METHODS

This study aimed to compare the performance of fluorescence spectroscopy, a simple and inexpensive method, with that of conventional techniques for diagnosing thalassemia. The red blood cell (RBC) counts and levels of Hb, HbA, HbA2, and HbS were estimated via conventional methods of complete blood count and Hb electrophoresis to diagnose thalassemia.

RESULTS

The RBCs and Hb, particularly the average values of HbA and HbA2, were lower in patients with thalassemia than in the normal controls. These hematologic parameters were also analyzed via fluorescence spectroscopybased on fluorescent biomolecules including tyrosine (275 nm), tryptophan (290 nm), nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) (370 nm), flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) (450 nm), and porphyrin (585-635 nm). In thalassemia patients, all these parameters were above the normal range, primarily due to abnormal depression of NADH and elevation of FAD.

CONCLUSION

Thalassemia canbe diagnosed via a fluorescent spectral method with an accuracy of 85% for blinded groups. This method may be useful for screening patients and reducing the cost of diagnosis in many rural countries.",,,,,"• RBC count

Among 18,166 cases, we found 2092 heterozygotes and 2245 β-TI individuals (who had no information about their disorders). Results were evaluated with standard hematological analyses including erythrocyte indices, hemoglobin (Hb) typing and quantification. Participants were divided into five groups (children, pre-marriage cases, pre-pregnancy cases, affected family members, pregnant women). The objectives of this evaluation were to fix cut-off values of red blood cells (RBCs), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular Hb (MCH), red blood cell distribution width (RDW) and Hb A2, as the standard World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines were not strictly followed in mass-scale screening programs. We have observed many dilemmas in considering the status of the thalassemia subject, due to presence of some other clinical conditions such as iron deficiency anemia, α-thalassemia (α-thal), δ-thalassemia (δ-thal), clinically silent Hb variants, and some cases of non hemoglobinopathies (such as pregnancy) along with thalassemia. The MCV values varied greatly in different conditions of hemoglobinopathies, whereas MCH provided a more stable measurement.

In the past few decades, migrants from the thalassaemia prevalent countries to non-prevalent countries, mainly North America and Central and North Europe, are rapidly increasing in number. The non-prevalent countries may not have established pre-natal screening system for thalassaemia.

Splenectomy was performed on 29 children with thalassemia major and 26 cases with thalassemia Hb E disease. Splenectomy performed on cases before hypersplenism appeared, showed better results then those late cases who have already symptoms of hypersplenism. Beside the medical points of view thalassemia has also many social aspects to be considered, those of the child itself, the parents and the society or community.",,,221 thalassemic children,splenectomy,

This study aims to report the current status of thalassaemia in Malaysia and provide a comprehensive understanding of the disease through data obtained from the Malaysian Thalassaemia Registry. Design Data were extracted from the Malaysian Thalassaemia Registry, a web-based system accessible to enrolled users through www.mytalasemia.net.my. Setting The Malaysian Thalassaemia Registry data was recorded from reports obtained from 110 participating government and university hospitals in Malaysia. Participants The patients were those attending the 110 participating hospitals for thalassaemia treatment. Intervention Data were collected from the Malaysian Thalassaemia Registry from 2007 until the fourth quarter of 2018. Primary outcome measure 7984 out of 8681 patients with thalassaemia registered in the Malaysian Thalassaemia Registry were reported alive. Results Majority of the patients were reported in the state of Sabah (22.72%); the largest age group affected was 5.0–24.9 years old (64.45%); the largest ethnic group involved was Malay (63.95%); and the major diagnosis was haemoglobin E/β-thalassaemia (34.37%). From the 7984 patients, 56.73% were on regular blood transfusions and 61.72% were on chelation therapy. A small fraction (14.23%) has undergone splenectomy, while the percentage of patients with severe iron overload (serum ferritin ≥5000 µg/L) reduced over time. However, cardiac complications are still the main cause of death in patients with thalassaemia. Conclusion Data gathered into the registry can be used to understand the progression of the disorder, to monitor iron overload management and to improve the outcomes of treatment, to enhance preventive strategies, reduce healthcare burden and improve the quality of life. Sustainability of the Malaysian Thalassaemia Registry is important for surveillance of thalassaemia management in the country and help the national health authorities to develop more effective policies.",,,7984,,"• 7984 out of 8681 patients with thalassaemia registered in the Malaysian Thalassaemia Registry were reported alive.

Materials and Methods: A total of 2046 patients from 27 thalassemia centers were registered, of which 1988 were eligible for analysis. This cohort mainly comprised patients with β-thalassemia major (n=1658, 83.4%) and intermedia (n=215, 10.8%). Results: The majority of patients were from the coastal areas of Turkey. The high number of patients in Southeastern Anatolia was due to that area having the highest rates of consanguineous marriage and fertility. The most common 11 mutations represented 90% of all β-thalassemia alleles and 47% of those were IVS1-110(G->A) mutations. The probability of undergoing splenectomy within the first 10 years of life was 20%, a rate unchanged since the 1980s. Iron chelators were administered as monotherapy regimens in 95% of patients and deferasirox was prescribed in 81.3% of those cases. Deferasirox administration was the highest (93.6%) in patients aged <10 years. Of the thalassemia major patients, 5.8% had match-related hemopoietic stem cell transplantation with a success rate of 77%. Cardiac disease was detected as a major cause of death and did not show a decreasing trend in 5-year cohorts since 1999. Conclusion: While the HCP has been implemented since 2003, the affected births have shown a consistent decrease only after 2009, being at lowest 34 cases per year. This program failure resulted from a lack of premarital screening in the majority of cases. Additional problems were unawareness of the risk and misinformation of the at-risk couples. In addition, prenatal diagnosis was either not offered to or was not accepted by the at-risk families. This study indicated that a continuous effort is needed for optimizing the management of thalassemia and the development of strategies is essential for further achievements in the HCP in Turkey.",,,1988 patients from 27 thalassemia centers,a hemoglobinopathy control program (HCP),"• demographic and disease characteristics of patients
